# lox-Interpreter
Two different implementations of the interpreter for the lox language, a compact yet full-fledged scripting language with dynamic type and garbage collection. 

The first interpreter, jlox, is based on Java and scanning-tree.

The second interpreter, clox, is a byte-code virual machine.
